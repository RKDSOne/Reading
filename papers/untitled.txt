# Jaynes Chapter 1

Plausible Reasoning: reasoning technique in AI, ML, etc. that involves a 
certain level of uncertainty or risk, so cannot gurantee aboslute
correct solutions (examples include use of probability methods)

Deductive Reasoning: reasoning from one or more statements to reach a logically CERTAIN
solution

Strong syllogism:

1.1 If A is T -> B is T :: If A is True -> B is True

and its inverse

1.2 If A is T -> B is T :: If B is False -> A is False

Weaker syllogism:

1.3 If A is T -> B is T :: If B is True -> A is more Plausible

1.4 If If A is T -> B is T :: A is False -> B is less Plausible

1.5 If A is B becomes more Plausible :: If B is True A becomes more Plausible

Polya worte about plausible reasoning

How could we build a machine which would carry out useful plausible reasoning, following clearly defined principles expressing an idealized common sense?

The Robot

* brain designed by us humans
* reasons according to rules
* desiderata - desired things
* robot reasons about propositions {A,B,C,D,E.....}
* propositions must be simple True or False

BOOLEAN ALGEBRA:

AB - A and B are both True

A + B - At least 1 of the two (A or B) is True
